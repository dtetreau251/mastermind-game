# Mastermind Game

This project is based on the popular deduction game, Mastermind, where players guess the color of hidden pegs. In this version, players take turns making a limited number of guesses and they use logic to deduce what numbers the computer has guessed.

## Lessons Learned

Creating my own computer game in Python was a great refresher in the Python programnming language. I used many core programming skills including variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and other techniques and algorithms. Also, I had the satisfaction to play the game I created! I used tools and libraries which I had not previously been exposed such as cowsay and termcolor.
